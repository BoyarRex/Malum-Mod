The process needed to obtain this holy syrup is rather simple. I start by stripping off the bark of an exposed piece of runewood, and then collect it all with a glass bottle.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_b": "After a brief taste test, I could feel a nourishing feeling course through me. It appears this substance holds some potent restorative properties, I should be able to further develop this ability by processing the sap into holy syrup, which should function as a minor healing elixir.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_c": "Furthermore, nothing is stopping me from mixing the sap with some slime. The result of my strange curiosity should come in the form of several holy sapballs, which should be able to function just like slime, effectively expanding my supply of the hard to come by resource. Gross.",

To combat this issue, the crucible allows for a secondary process known to most as arcane restoration. This process is, in a way, the flipside of spirit focusing.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_b": "Instead of splitting off mass from any given item, an impetus for example, arcane restoration utilizes spirit arcana to recover the lost form of any given damaged item. To do this I will need to create a twisted tablet.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_c": "The twisted tablet is a simple augmentation of a rather usual item stand with a more esoteric design allowing for greater functionality. It must be placed facing the crucible on a matching axis position.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_a": "Hellish magic is incredibly dangerous, and by far the most diabolical. Playing with fire is usually not a good idea, but that's not gonna stop me.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_b": "Infernal arcana is great at many things: light, explosions, fire, the list goes on.

The Encyclopedia Arcana will be it's new name.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_c": "The codex states that there is great power within the soul and notes some strange findings about this rather wicked form of arcane arts known as spirit magic. It appears to be a very cruel, inhumane and generally frowned upon study of arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_d": "From my understanding, at the very core of every soul there seems to exist an untapped magical affinity, which appears to be closely tied to the very existence of the soul.

They used to function as a tuning mechanism of sorts present within an alchemical exchange system.

To satisfy my greed for power I have forged the ring of esoteric spoils, which allows the wearer to reap an extra spirit from every soul shattered. I am a little concerned with how this extra spirit comes to be, but I must not worry about it now.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_a": "I believe that the soul holds more than just spirit flux within it. Brilliance, known to most as experience can also be found within.

Even just touching the sapling creates a warm feeling, one that I can feel in my very soul.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "The weapon is created, and after sharpening the blade I waited for the night to set and went on my first soul hunt. To say the least, it went well.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_a": "The soulstone is a strange mineral I have found near the surface and in deepslate layers of the underground. It's existence is most certainly a result of spirit magics, and it seems to be structured similarly to other minerals.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_b": "I can't exactly replicate, or even comprehend the process used to create Soulstone, so the deposits of ore I found underground will have to suffice.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_a": "By utilizing the magical Runewood I have created an altar which should serve as a basis for all my magical studies and crafts.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_b": "Every spirit infusion recipe requires an item to function as an epicenter of the process. You will also need a set of spirit arcana to merge with any given item. These ingredients must all be placed within the spirit altar. As soon as all of them are present the spirit altar will spur into motion and begin to infuse magic into the item.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_c": "More often than not, spirit infusion will require additional reagents to be infused alongside spirit arcana. To provide the altar with these extra ingredients I have created some runewood item holders, an item stand, and an item pedestal. These hold a single stack of an item, and must be placed within 4 blocks of the altar.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_jar": "The spirit jar is a simple yet convenient creation of mine. It can store what most presume to be an infinite amount of a single spirit, but no one really knows for sure.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_b": "Once this blade is in my hands, I should be ready to start hunting for spirit arcana.

I believe that I'll be able to find different magical elements within different living souls.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_c": "As I previously noted, each living soul is powered by the spirit flux found deep within, but that spirit flux isn't just a simple fuel for the soul. It is a magical element, often mixed in with other forms of itself, all found within the same soul. What this means is that each soul is unique, composed of a different combination of spirit flux.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_d": "For example, I believe that the soul of a fiery being, like the blaze, should in some form represent the fiery nature of it's vessel. Likewise, the soul of a peaceful, vigorous being, should also contain flux which represents the calm nature of the being.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_plunder": "The spirit plunder enchantment brings out more of the potential found within the precious soulstone, any soul shattered through the use of this enchanted scythe will yield extra spirits.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets_a": "A trinket is a simple accessory designed to aid the wearer, some know these trinkets as either baubles or curios.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets_b": "In their most primitive form, Gilded trinkets provide boosts to armor while ornate steelwear yields armor toughness.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tainted_rock": "By infusing the earth with sacred and raw arcana a new stone with plenty of building options is created.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_corruption_b": "The uncontrolled and volatile result of arcane spirit channels all the built up power and spontaneously corrupts the totem, twisting the simple and organized runewood into a much grimmer new purple look.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic_b": "Each spirit rite starts at the totem base, above which there must be sufficient runewood logs to hold the array of engraved spirits.
