They're filled with plenty of inexplicable things of unknown origin, automaton-like guardians, drowned risen from the undead, various ruins and monuments, there's too much we don't know. Aqueous sorcery is extremely potent, and is found mainly within various sea-born souls.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_charcoal": "After running short on fuel, I decided to process my newly found runewood into charcoal. To my surprise however, the resulting fuel retains some of this magical property, and as a result functions as a longer lasting fuel source. From my so-far brief use of it, I can tell that it is twice as potent as regular fuel.",

To satisfy my greed for power I have forged the ring of arcane spoil, which will allow the wearer to reap an extra spirit from every soul shattered.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ceaseless_impetus_b": "In addition to a more sturdy design made out of hallowed gold, the ceaseless impetus allows for two uses before needing repair.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_a": "The crucible is a rather heavy and slow piece of spirit engineering, and that is not without a reason. For you see; the impetus can be really easily damaged, the process of spirit focusing heavily relies on a slow and constant input of arcana in order to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the catalyst.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_b": "Increasing the rate at which arcana is streamed into the impetus would yield a faster result but it could lead to your catalyst getting damaged more than necessary.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_spirit_a": "While raw arcana functions as an amplifier, eldritch arcana works much like a strong catalyst. It is much more potent but incredibly rare.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_spirit_b": "I am a little puzzled by this spirit. Much like the otherworldly soul that used to hold the magic, I am unsure what to make of it. It seems that there is something within the sealed off dimension that brings forth this spirit within the souls born in the realm. I am not sure if it belongs to any other creature.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_wicked_rite": "Adding in eldritch magic enhances the already dangerous rite and allows it to kill.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_a": "I have heard gossip of a flame that can burn forever, and decided to bring forth such wonder. Ether is a harmless, magical flame that burns and shines bright forever. It can be placed on a torch or a magical brazier which can may be grounded or hung.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_b": "Additionally, Ether can be dyed into practically any color. Simply combining the ether item with any combination of dyes will change the light it emits. Utilizing monochromatic colors however seems to instead create a much dimmer result, difficult to see. It allowing for a hidden light of sorts.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_a": "Furthermore, arcane restoration isn't restricted to just repairing your impetus; it extends much further. Using the restoring process we are able to repair nearly any damaged item.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_a": "Gold is very often used as a basis for various magics, I believe this property to be relevant when dealing with soul magic as well. Infusing raw and sacred arcana into a gold ingot will imbue it with magic and yield a much more desirable arcane metal. A few additional reagents are also required for this infusion.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_b": "While not too useful in evil schemes or crafting powerful gear, hallowed gold is a metal perfect for spirit manipulation and transfer.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.haunted": "When a soul is damaged a lot of it's integrity is lost, resulting in some of it's magical energy being released. The haunted enchantment converts that magic energy into extra magic damage to anyone cut by the blade. Higher tiers damage the target further.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hex_ash": "As a test of this altar, I have created a powder which I will call Hex ash. It is a simple grit which I will use as a minor ingredient in various magics. The ash is imbued with arcane spirit, which I have taken from a skeleton.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_a": "This strange tree keeps surprising me, I have found a special type of sap that grows within the tree. To get your hands on this holy extract you'll need an axe. Start by stripping off the bark of an exposed piece of runewood, and then collect it all with a glass bottle.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_b": "After a brief taste test, I could feel a nourishing feeling course through me. It appears this substance holds some potent restorative properties, I should be able to further develop this ability by processing the sap into holy syrup, which should function as a minor healing elixir.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_c": "Furthermore, nothing was stopping me from mixing the sap with some slime. The result of my curiosity comes in the form of several holy sapballs, which should be able to function just like slime, effectively expanding my supply of the hard to come by resource. Gross.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_a": "When an impetus sustains enough damage it will crack, becoming unusable for spirit focusing. To combat this issue, the crucible has a secondary function known to most as arcane restoration. This process expands upon spirit focusing and flips it upside down.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_b": "Instead of splitting off mass from any given item, an impetus for example, arcane restoration utilizes spirit arcana to recover the lost form of your damaged item. To do this you will need to create a twisted tablet.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_c": "The twisted tablet is a simple augmentation of your usual item stand; the difference is that the tablet has the ability to channel spirit arcana without the need for an outside source to draw it out. It must be placed facing the crucible on a matching axis position.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_rite": "The infernal rite provides one of many auras. Nearby players will receive haste.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_a": "Hellish magic is incredibly dangerous, and by far the most diabolical. Playing with fire is usually not a good idea, but that's not gonna stop me.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_b": "Infernal arcana is great at many things: light, explosions, fire, the list goes on. The magic allows for a wide variety of effects, however I have only found it in a rather narrow selection of souls. I believe the nether will prove very useful to me here.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_a": "Within our world, every living body has a soul. The soul is one's consciousness and what animates the body, the physical vessel for the arcane presence. Both represent who we are, while the body is your physical fortress, the soul is your arcane image.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_b": "The Encyclopedia Arcana, as I have named it, is a journal which will contain all my gathered knowledge on everything that is known about the soul. To be more exact, this codex of mine will focus on a rather wicked form of arcane arts known as soul magic. It is a very cruel, inhumane and generally frowned upon study of arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_c": "At the very core of every soul there seems to exist an untapped source of power, which appears to be closely tied to the very existence of the soul. While normally it is a simple flux within the soul, I believe if we are to separate this flux from the arcane presence, it will solidify into a crystal of sorts.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_d": "The power of each individual soul derives almost entirely from the spirit flux found within it's core. These spirits serve as the basis for the very existence of the magical properties of every soul there is. I speculate that if a soul is removed from it's spirit flux within, it will become a blank slate without any true purpose.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_a": "While ether is already quite appealing, iridescent ether takes that glimmering shine a step further. This pristine form of ether allows us to dye the item once more to alter the ending color of the burn. Much like normal ether it can be placed on a brazier and a torch",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_b": "Getting just the right coloring for your light may be a bit tricky however. You cannot alter the original color of ether once it's transformed into it's iridescent variant, applying any dye at this stage will only change the second color.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.magebane_belt": "By twisting a warded belt into it's rather sinister alter ego we may create the magebane belt. This alteration exchanges defense for offense, providing greater magic resistance and extra soul ward. Additionally, any damage absorbed by soul ward will make it's way to the inflicter.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_a": "With some clever tricks I have created a metallic impetus, which can be used to form metallic nodes of nearly any metal desired. These nodes can then be processed directly into nuggets. Due to the more rigid material of the catalyst, more durability is lost in the process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_b": "This design is not my own however, these metallic catalysts were previously used as some sort of ashen aspects in an alchemical exchange system based on infernal arcana, I do not know all the details to it, nor do I wish to delve into it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.mirror_magic": "Coming soon!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror": "A whole lot of gear, trinkets and armor alike grant an effect when collecting spirits. By utilizing primitive mirror magic we can siphon some raw arcana off of your magic attacks and utilize it to trigger those effects. This necklace does just that.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge": "The scythe sweep attack can be extremely useful in clearing through hordes of prey, however in other cases it can be seen as unnecessary or even impractical. This iron necklace will completely remove your scythe's sweep attack in exchange for a strong damage increase.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rebound": "The rebound enchantment is by far the strangest one of all. It will grant the user the ability to throw the scythe like a boomerang, allowing for a wacky ranged attack. Higher tiers reduce the delay before the scythe can be thrown once more.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_curative_talent": "Tears of the ghast have some really strong curative properties. Combining one with some sacred arcana and infusing both into a gilded ring will yield us the ring of curative talent. This simple trinket will recover a large portion of your health when collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_a": "The soul holds more than just spirit flux within it, brilliance, also known as experience can be found within. Unlike spirits, brilliance has a rather loose connection to the soul, even just slaying the vessel through regular means releases some of this stored brilliance.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_b": "As with all things, we can't let the soul keep anything for itself. With some clever manipulation of raw arcana combined with natural brilliance we can leech off some extra experience from the dying soul. The ring of prowess does just that, awarding the bearer with experience as they collect each individual spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_wicked_intent": "The wicked ring is a simple yet practical trinket that will greatly assist you in combat. Taking note from the powerful wither army the ring will react to nearby spirit arcana and reward you with strength and rage when collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_a": "While adventuring I have found a strange tree, it grows in plains and forests and holds a yellow crown. It is a display of pure arcane energy, I believe it's bark and wood will prove itself useful to me. I shall name it Runewood, in note of it's magical nature.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_b": "Due to it's magical nature, the wood of the tree appears to function as a great conductor for magic. Even just touching the sapling creates a warm feeling, which I can feel in my very soul. It appears that anything with enough magical energy within is able to impose itself on your very soul, almost as if touching it directly.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_obelisk": "If you've ever wished for a means of speeding up your spirit infusion, the runewood obelisk is perfect for your needs. It functions as a booster pillar of sorts, the spirit arcana imbued within allow it to accelerate the infusion process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite": "The sacred rite is the simplest rite there is. It'll provide a weak healing effect to all nearby players.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_a": "That which is sacred stands originates from two main concepts, the vigorous and the holy. Sacred arcana provides various forms of healing and other curative effects.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_b": "Sacred Arcana can be found mainly within passive, relaxed souls. Beings of holy origin should also hold this magic within their soul.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythe_enchanting": "At it's core, the scythe is much like any other weapon within my arsenal, we can enchant it and bring out more of it's power.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_a": "With the Soulstone in my possession, I have designed a weapon which I will use as my primary gate to harnessing the power that is spirit arcana, the scythe; for I am the reaper. I will embed the Soulstone in the crude iron blade to allow it to damage the soul of the target, and hopefully destroy it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "The weapon is created, and after sharpening the blade I waited for the night to set and went on my first soul hunt. To say the least, it went well. I felt a powerful egocentric feeling course through me as I heard the soul of my many victims shatter and release the spirit flux found within.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_c": "Just as I speculated, when the flux is released from a shattered soul it takes on a crystal form which we can even hold. I shall name this form a spirit arcana splinter, or spirit for short. I must further research my newly attained power.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_hunter_armor": "The soul hunter armor is an armor set designed all around expanding the users magical ability. You may create it using spirit fabric and some primitive leather armor. While it does not provide much shielding, it greatly enhances my magical abilities.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_a": "Just like with the scythe, we can reinforce crude and boring iron armor using soul stained steel. In it's new purple form, apart from rather high levels of protection the armor also provides a passive barrier against magic damage. On top of that, the armor coats the wearer's soul with a protective barrier known as Soul ward.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_b": "Soul Ward is a potent arcane barrier designed for magic attacks. It will recover over time, and absorb almost all of magic damage taken as well as a small amount of physical damage dealt to the wearer. I hope to research this barrier further and unlock more of it's potential",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_armor_c": "Wearing an armor set made out of soul stained steel was a daunting thought at first, the nature of the metal would quickly rend my soul. To prevent this unfortunate scenario, the armor must be forged with a protective twisted rock layer underneath the dangerous metal.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_scythe": "After some time using the crude scythe I have grown tired of the primitive weapon. By utilizing soul stained steel we can create a direct upgrade with overall higher damage distributed between physical and magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_a": "The sacred origins of hallowed gold make it nearly impossible to use for harm. Soul stained steel is nothing like that, it's a tough metal twisted beyond recognition. It is designed to inflict pain.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soul_stained_steel_b": "Any piece of gear made from soul stained steel is capable of shattering souls much like a scythe. Said gear also holds the ability to deal magic damage after every strike. Both metals can also be used to create a type of magic transmitter. A spirit resonator, a more complex crafting component in various arcane designs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_a": "The soulstone is a strange mineral found both nearby the surface and in the deepslate layer of our world. It's existence is most certainly a result of spirit magics, and seems to closely relate to carbon. I'll research it's origin further in the future.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_b": "I can't exactly replicate, or even comprehend the process used to create Soulstone, so the deposits of ore I found underground will have to suffice. Furthermore, Soulstone appears to be the exact thing we need, a great catalyst for soul magics and other diabolical fields, perfect for our weapon.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone_c": "Note: Do not touch the mineral in it's base form! As I gripped the purple gemstone, I felt a strange surge of energy approach my very soul. It was a small yet very uncomfortable pain that I do not want to feel ever again.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_a": "Spirit magics focus on turning everything good in the world to evil. Sometimes, by pure coincidence a great thing is created instead, as is the case with runewood. It is important to realize this mistake and correct it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood_b": "By utilizing the dangerous arcane spirit rite we can easily create soulwood, any nearby runewood block is a valid target for this transmutation. Much like it's name implies, soulwood has a strong connection to more direct soul magics. It'll be sure to come in use.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric": "Spirit fabric is a light cloth used for a few key spirit infusions and crafting recipes. The material is very sturdy and produces a powerful wicked aura.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing_a": "The spirit crucible is a wondrous device. It is used to perform an alchemical process named spirit focusing, it revolves around a single key catalyst and the interactions between it and spirit arcana. One of the more common catalysts found in this magical process is an alchemical impetus.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing_b": "The impetus is a clay-made artifact of ancient design, it's very easy to shape it's earthen mass into new form. By utilizing spirits in the crucible we may shape some of the impetus' mass into something new at the cost of a slight toll on the clay artifact's durability.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_a": "By utilizing the magical Runewood I have created an altar which I will utilize for all my magical processes. Here I can perform a process known as Spirit Infusion. It is a crafting process based around infusing spirit arcana into various items, twisting them to fit your evil desires.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_b": "Every spirit infusion recipe requires an item to function as an epicenter of the process. You will also need a set of spirit arcana to merge with your item. These ingredients must all be placed within the spirit altar. As soon as all of them are present the spirit altar will spur into motion and begin to infuse magic into the item.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion_c": "More often than not, spirit infusion will require additional reagents to be infused alongside spirit arcana. To provide the altar with these extra ingredients I have created some runewood item holders, an item stand, and an item pedestal. These hold a single stack of an item, and must be placed within 4 blocks of the altar.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_jar": "The spirit jar is a simple yet convenient block. It can store what I presume to be an infinite amount of a single spirit. Spirits may be inserted and taken from the jar by interacting with it, sneaking will take out an entire stack.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_a": "\"How do I get my greedy little hands on a spirit?\" You might wonder, as I did. To start, we must forge a trusty yet wicked weapon. This weapon we hope to create should be capable of making direct contact with the core of the soul, and hopefully destroying it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_b": "Once this tool is in our hands, we should be ready to start hunting for spirit arcana. After some research, I have concluded that there are eight different primary forms of this magic, which should all reside within different types of living souls. Depending on which type of spirit arcana we wish to obtain, we will need to set out to hunt different foes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_c": "As I previously noted each living soul is powered by the spirit flux found deep within, but that spirit flux isn't just a simple fuel for the soul. It is a magical element, often mixed in with other forms of itself, all found within the same soul! What this means is that each soul is unique, composed of a different combination of spirit flux.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_magics_d": "For example, I believe that the soul of a fiery being, like the blaze, should in some form represent the fiery nature of it's vessel. Likewise, the soul of a peaceful, vigorous being, should also contain flux which represents the calm nature of the being.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_plunder": "The spirit plunder enchantment brings out more of the potential found within the precious soulstone, any soul shattered through the use of this enchanted scythe will yield extra spirits. This may however damage the soulstone, taking extra durability off of your scythe.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_pouch": "I have grown very tired of carrying all my spirit arcana, the spirit pouch offers a solution to this annoyance. The item allows us to store a large amount of spirits within it's internal inventory. On top of that, any spirits we gather are automatically stored in the pouch.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets_a": "A trinket is a simple accessory that will provide the wearer with helpful benefits, some know them as baubles or curios. Hallowed Gold and Soul Stained Steel both offer two basic trinkets that all serve as a basic form, which can be further mangled with through spirit magics.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets_b": "In their most primitive form, Gilded trinkets provide boosts to armor while ornate steelwear yields armor toughness.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tainted_rock": "By infusing the earth with sacred and raw arcana a new stone with plenty of building options is created. Tainted rock is a simple magical construct which happens to hold strong magic-suppressing properties, and can be shaped into item holders much like runewood.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.the_device": "even works while bended",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_corruption_a": "Raw arcana is often used to amplify other magics, it is usually used on within a spirit rite as a starting point of sorts. Now what if, we execute a rite made out of entirely arcane spirit, where would the built up magics go? The answer is corruption.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_corruption_b": "The uncontrolled and volatile result of arcane spirit channels all the built up power and spontaneously corrupts the totem, twisting the simple and organized runewood into a much grimmer new purple look. Any spirit rite performed on a soulwood totem will yield different effects.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_corruption_c": "You may also craft a corrupted totem base directly by changing the ingredients.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic_a": "Through the use of spirit arcana we may not only forge new wonders, but also perform rituals. By engraving spirits onto runewood in a specific order you may create a spirit rite, a dark ritual that mangles with the nearby area.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic_b": "Each spirit rite starts at the totem base, above which there must be sufficient runewood logs to hold the array of engraved spirits. Spirits can be stripped off of runewood by using an axe. When you lay out your rite correctly, activate the totem base to activate the ritual.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic_c": "There exists one limitation to this primitive system, no two matching spirit rites can be active within the range of one another.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.twisted_rock": "If we are to replace sacred arcana with it's opposite the resulting stone yields a much grimmer appearance. Twisted rock is indifferent from it's holy variant apart from the darker tone.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving_a": "The Tyrving is a rather esoteric blade. It's strange design makes it appear as a weak weapon not suited for combat. However, it's hex ash lining and twisted rock form cause it to deal extra magic damage to the soul, the greater the soul the more benefit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving_b": "The weapon can also be repaired using arcane restoration quite efficiently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.voodoo_magic": "Coming soon!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.warded_belt": "By taking the already armored design of a gilded belt and imbuing it with earthen arcana and a tainted rock reinforcement we can create a powerful belt which serves as a great protective piece of gear.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_rite": "The wicked rite is a harmful one. Nearby hostiles will slowly receive non-lethal magic damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_spirit_a": "Flipside of the sacred, wicked spirit represents various impurities and dark magics. Even just touching this spirit creates a mild pain within your soul.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_spirit_b": "Generally when a vessel rots, the soul peacefully fades out into the afterlife. However, if the body is to be reanimated back to life through necromancy, or some other arcane art, the soul and vessel may be one once more. This however scars the the soul, twisting it into a more wicked shape.",
